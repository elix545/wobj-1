WOBJ JSON Parsing Library

Documentation for WOBJ can be found at docs.zumasys.com. Search for 'WOBJ'.

This is the first push of the WOBJ library.  The core code is in WOBJ.  Platform specific code is in the seperate directories.

To install on your platform first bring down the main WOBJ library and put it in a seperate BP file (like WOBJ.BP).  Then
download the specific code from your platform's directory and overwrite that code.  The default code is jBase.

Then compile the code down.  WOBJ is the primary subroutine.  TEST.WOBJ is a simple sample program.
